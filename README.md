# Welcome to my portfolio!

Welcome to my data analyst portfolio! This repository showcases my skills, project experience, and approach to solving real-world data problems. Here, you'll find selected projects that demonstrate my expertise in data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization. My goal is to provide clear, actionable insights through data-driven analysis.

## **About Me**

I'm an operations data analyst based in Kista, Sweden, with a passion for transforming raw data into meaningful insights. My background includes hands-on experience with data cleaning, Power BI (especially Power Query), and building models that support business decisions. I also enjoy table tennis and sci-fi, with *Blade Runner* as my all-time favorite for its immersive atmosphere and storytelling.
